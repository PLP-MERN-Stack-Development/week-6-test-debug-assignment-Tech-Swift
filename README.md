# MERN Testing & Debugging Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive testing and debugging strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Client:** Jest and React Testing Library are used for React components and utility functions (see `client/src/tests/unit/`).
- **Server:** Jest and Supertest for controllers and models (see `server/tests/unit/`).

### Integration Testing
- **Client:** API utility functions are tested with mocked HTTP requests (see `client/src/tests/integration/`).
- **Server:** Supertest is used to test Express routes with in-memory MongoDB (`server/tests/integration/`).

### End-to-End Testing
- **Client:** Cypress (or Playwright) is used for user flow tests (`client/cypress/`).

### Tools Used
- Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, Cypress, MongoDB Memory Server.

## Debugging Techniques
- Used `console.log` and breakpoints for troubleshooting.
- Implemented error boundaries in React.
- Added custom error messages and handled async errors.
- Used test failures to guide bug fixes.

## Test Coverage

![Client Coverage Report](./screenshots/client-coverage.png)
![Server Coverage Report](./screenshots/server-coverage.png)

Run coverage with:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Setup & Running Tests

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run test:e2e    # for end-to-end tests
```

This assignment focuses on implementing comprehensive testing strategies for a MERN stack application, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, along with debugging techniques.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up testing environments for both client and server
2. Write unit tests for React components and server functions
3. Implement integration tests for API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. Apply debugging techniques for common MERN stack issues
